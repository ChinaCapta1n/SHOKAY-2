                Here at Shokay, we provide yak wool that is sustainable, soft, warm, and incredibly versatile. <br>
                Despite the unmatched qualities, most brands still need to familiarise themselves with how to use the fibre.
            </p>
            <p class="p-style">Thatâ€™s why we offer as much involvement as you prefer.</p>
            <p class="p-style">Whether you would rather a beautifully designed knit collection ready to stock your shelves,
                or to simply source sustainable yak wool, we do it all.</p>
